<p>Here we introduce the usage of <code>celltype</code> package. The main function uses a dictionary of immune cell markers that consist on expression level measurements of genes in different immune cell types. We use this dictionary to predict the likely cell type of a experimental dataset of single cell transcriptome measurements. The assignment is made using correlation between the expression levels of the markers in the dictionary and the same genes in the cells.</p>
